Command Palette in Visual Studio Code:

The Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Command+Shift+P on macOS) was used to invoke the .NET: New Project command to create the application.
Integrated Terminal:

The terminal within Visual Studio Code was used to execute commands for building and running the application.
.NET CLI:

The command-line interface included with the .NET SDK was utilized for creating the project template and managing the build and execution process.
